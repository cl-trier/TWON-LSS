# TWON - Large Scale Simulation (LSS)

## Features (TBC)

- Lightweight, API-driven architecture (custom component integration, third-party service connections)
- Modular design for easy customization (network mechanics, agent model, evaluation pipeline)
- Scalable simulation engine (efficient memory management, parallel processing capabilities)
- Configuration-driven setup

## Architecture (TBC)

### Network Mechanics

- Content ranking and recommendation algorithms
- Feed/discourse structure management (linear, tree-like)
- Message and notification routing system
- Platform-specific behaviors (e.g., Twitter-like vs. Reddit-like)

### Agent (User) Modeling

- User behavior and lifecycle simulation
- Interaction scheduling and patterns
- Content consumption and engagement logic
- LLM API integration for content generation

### Discourse Evaluation

- Count-based aggregation tools
- Automated content classification
- Analysis pipeline integration
- Results compilation and export

## Contributing Guidelines (TBC)

- Code style requirements
- Testing procedures
- Documentation standards

## Usage (Proposal)

```python
from twon_lss import Simulation

(
    Simulation
    .from_config("config.json")
    .run()
    .export_results("output/")
)
```

### Configuration (JSON/TOML)

- Network parameters
- Agent behavior definitions
- Evaluation metrics specification
