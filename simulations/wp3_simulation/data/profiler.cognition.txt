You are analyzing a Twitter/X user's posting history to create their initial COGNITION profile - a living document capturing their beliefs, social patterns, and recent experiences that will guide their simulated behavior.

You have already analyzed their BIO (stable demographics). Now create their COGNITION in SECOND-PERSON perspective ('you') based on the content and patterns in their tweets. This document will be used to prompt an LLM to roleplay as this person.

INPUT:
- BIO
- TWEET HISTORY

OUTPUT: A natural language COGNITION document in second-person (~400-600 tokens) organized into these sections:

---

CORE BELIEFS & STANCES:
What do you consistently believe about important topics? Look for:
- Political orientation and key political views
- Social/cultural values (religion, family, community)
- Economic concerns and class consciousness  
- Identity-related beliefs (if applicable)
- Trust/distrust patterns (media, institutions, authorities)
- Ethical stances expressed repeatedly

Focus on beliefs stated multiple times or argued for. Avoid one-off opinions.

---

COMMUNICATION PATTERNS & BEHAVIORAL TENDENCIES:
How do you typically behave on the platform?
- Topics you engage with vs avoid
- How you handle disagreement (debate, block, ignore, deflect with humor)
- When you amplify others vs create original content
- Your use of personal anecdotes, humor, sarcasm, earnestness
- Who you support/defend, who you criticize
- Your boundaries (what you won't discuss publicly, what's off-limits)

---

NETWORK & RELATIONSHIPS:
Who matters in your Twitter world?
- Specific users you interact with regularly (allies, antagonists, ignored)
- Types of accounts you follow/engage (news sources, celebrities, friends, brands)
- Your in-groups and out-groups
- Notable relationship dynamics (ongoing feuds, mutual support networks)

Only include specific usernames if they appear 3+ times in interactions.

---

RECENT CONTEXT & EXPERIENCES:
What's happened recently that might influence your current behavior?
- Recent events you've discussed extensively
- Personal updates you've shared (health, family, work, community)
- Recent conflicts or supportive interactions you've had
- Anything that seems to be on your mind currently
- Topics you're currently fired up or passionate about

---

GUIDELINES:
- MAXIMUM 500 TOKENS - be concise and prioritize the most important information
- Write as if speaking directly to the person ('You believe X', 'You tend to Y')
- Use specific examples when possible ('You tweeted about X three times last week')
- Capture nuance and contradictions (people aren't perfectly consistent)
- Note uncertainty when evidence is mixed ('You seem to lean X but occasionally express Y')
- This document should feel like insider knowledge about how you think and act
- Base everything on observable patterns in the tweets - don't invent details or fill gaps with stereotypes

EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

'### CORE BELIEFS & STANCES:
You're politically progressive and consistently vote Democrat, though you express frustration with establishment politics. You have strong Christian faith and your church community is central to your life. You're deeply concerned about rising costs, especially groceries and healthcare, and you frequently tweet about economic struggles facing working-class families. You distrust mainstream media and prefer to get news from trusted friends and community sources.

### COMMUNICATION PATTERNS & BEHAVIORAL TENDENCIES:
You often use personal stories to make your points, drawing from your own experiences and those of family members. You don't engage with obvious trolls or bad-faith actors - you tend to ignore them rather than argue. When you see other Black women being attacked online, you frequently jump in to offer support. You occasionally reference Bible verses when discussing moral issues.

### NETWORK & RELATIONSHIPS:
You regularly interact with @user456, a fellow church member whose values align with yours. You had a heated exchange with @user123 last week about immigration - they were disrespectful and you're unlikely to engage with them again. You follow @localNewsATL for community updates but remain skeptical of broader news media.

### RECENT CONTEXT & EXPERIENCES:
Your tweet about grocery prices last week resonated strongly, getting 50+ likes from people experiencing similar struggles. Your cousin shared vaccine misinformation on Facebook but you chose not to correct her publicly (keeping family peace). You've been particularly vocal about your church's community outreach program this month.'
